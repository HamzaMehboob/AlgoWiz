# AVL Tree Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of an AVL Tree in Python. An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one.

## Features

- **Insert**: Add a new node while maintaining the AVL property.
- **Inorder Traversal**: Retrieve all nodes in sorted order.

## Installation

To use the AVL Tree implementation, you need Python installed on your machine. No additional libraries are required.

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HamzaMehboob/AlgoWiz.git
    cd AlgoWiz/DataStructure/AVLTree
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    As there are no external dependencies, you can skip this step.

## Usage

1. **Run the Example**

    The `example.py` file demonstrates how to use the `AVLTree` class. To run the example, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python example.py
    ```

2. **Modify the Code**

    You can modify `example.py` to test different operations or integrate the `AVLTree` class into your own projects.

## File Descriptions

- **`avl_tree.py`**: Contains the implementation of the `AVLTree` class and its methods.
- **`example.py`**: Provides an example of how to use the `AVLTree` class.
