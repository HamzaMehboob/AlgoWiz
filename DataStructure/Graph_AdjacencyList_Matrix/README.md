# Graph Representation Using Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix

This repository contains implementations of graph representations using an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix in Python.

## Features

- **GraphAdjList**: Implements a graph using an adjacency list.
- **GraphAdjMatrix**: Implements a graph using an adjacency matrix.

## Installation

To use the graph implementations, you need Python installed on your machine. No additional libraries are required.

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HamzaMehboob/AlgoWiz.git
    cd AlgoWiz/DataStructure/Graph_AdjacencyList_Matrix
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    As there are no external dependencies, you can skip this step.

## Usage

1. **Run the Example**

    The `example.py` file demonstrates how to use the `GraphAdjList` and `GraphAdjMatrix` classes. To run the example, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python example.py
    ```

2. **Modify the Code**

    You can modify `example.py` to test different graph operations or integrate the `GraphAdjList` and `GraphAdjMatrix` classes into your own projects.

## File Descriptions

- **`graph.py`**: Contains the implementations of `GraphAdjList` and `GraphAdjMatrix` classes.
- **`example.py`**: Provides examples of how to use the `GraphAdjList` and `GraphAdjMatrix` classes.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.
