# Fenwick Tree Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) in Python. A Fenwick Tree is a data structure that provides efficient methods for querying prefix sums and updating elements.

## Features

- **Update**: Add a value to a specific index.
- **Query**: Retrieve the prefix sum from the start to a specific index.
- **Range Query**: Retrieve the sum of values within a specific range.

## Installation

To use the Fenwick Tree implementation, you need Python installed on your machine. No additional libraries are required.

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HamzaMehboob/AlgoWiz.git
    cd AlgoWiz/DataStructure/FenWickTree
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    As there are no external dependencies, you can skip this step.

## Usage

1. **Run the Example**

    The `example.py` file demonstrates how to use the `FenwickTree` class. To run the example, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python example.py
    ```

2. **Modify the Code**

    You can modify `example.py` to test different operations or integrate the `FenwickTree` class into your own projects.

## File Descriptions
