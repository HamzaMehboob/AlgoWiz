# AlgoWiz

AlgoWiz is a comprehensive collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Python. This repository includes various algorithms and data structures to help you understand and implement core computational techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- **`Algorithms/`**: Contains implementations of different algorithms, including sorting, searching, graph algorithms, string algorithms, dynamic programming, and machine learning algorithms.
- **`DataStructures/`**: Contains implementations of fundamental data structures such as trees and graphs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AlgoWiz.git
    cd AlgoWiz
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Some algorithms or data structures might require additional Python libraries. Install the dependencies using:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Each folder may have its own `requirements.txt` file if specific dependencies are needed.

## Usage

1. **Navigate to the Desired Folder**

    Change directory to the folder of interest. For example, to use sorting algorithms:

    ```bash
    cd Algorithms/Sorting
    ```

2. **Run Example Scripts**

    Each folder contains an `example.py` file that demonstrates how to use the implemented algorithms or data structures. Run the example script using:

    ```bash
    python example.py
    ```

3. **Integrate and Modify**

    You can integrate the provided implementations into your own projects or modify the code to fit your needs.
