# Dijkstra's Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm in Python for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. This algorithm is commonly used in network routing protocols and geographical mapping applications.

## Introduction

Dijkstra's Algorithm is a popular algorithm used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. It uses a priority queue to explore nodes in order of their current known shortest distance from the source node, ensuring that each node's shortest path is found efficiently.

## Features

- Supports adding nodes and edges to the graph.
- Calculates the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph.
- Prints the shortest distance and path from the source node to a target node.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HamzaMehboob/AlgoWiz.git
    cd AlgoWiz/Algorithms/PathFinding/Dijkstar_Python
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python dijkstar.py
    ```
