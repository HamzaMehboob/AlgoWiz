# A* Algorithm

This project implements the A* pathfinding algorithm in Python. The A* algorithm is widely used in games and robotics for finding the shortest path from a start node to a goal node.

## Installation

No additional libraries are required for this implementation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HamzaMehboob/AlgoWiz.git
    cd AlgoWiz/Algorithms/PathFinding/AStar_Python
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python astar.py
    ```

## Example

The script finds the shortest path in a graph from node 'A' to node 'G'. The graph and heuristic values are hardcoded in the script for demonstration purposes.
