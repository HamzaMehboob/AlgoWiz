# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles). This implementation in Python demonstrates how to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph.
