# HeapSort Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the HeapSort algorithm in Python. HeapSort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.

## Introduction

HeapSort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses the binary heap data structure to sort elements. It works by first building a max heap from the input array, then repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap and rebuilding the heap.

## Features

- Efficient sorting algorithm.
- Uses binary heap data structure.
- Handles arrays with duplicate values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HamzaMehboob/AlgoWiz.git
    cd AlgoWiz/Algorithms/Sorting/HeapSort_Python
    ```

2. Run the example script:
    ```sh
    python example.py
    ```
