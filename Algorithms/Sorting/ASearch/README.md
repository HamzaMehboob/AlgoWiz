# Interpolation Search Algorithm

Interpolation Search is an improved version of binary search for uniformly distributed data. It estimates the position of the target value based on the values at the ends of the array segment.

## Files

- `interpolation_search.py`: Contains the implementation of the Interpolation Search algorithm.
- `example.py`: Provides an example of how to use the InterpolationSearch class to search for a value in a sorted list.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. Run `example.py` to see the Interpolation Search algorithm in action:

    ```bash
    python example.py
    ```

4. The output will show the index at which the target value was found in the given data list.

## Example

In the provided `example.py`, the algorithm searches for the value `70` in the sorted list `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]`. The output should be:
