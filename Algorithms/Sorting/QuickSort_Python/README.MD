# QuickSort Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the QuickSort algorithm in Python. QuickSort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that is efficient for sorting large datasets.

## Introduction

QuickSort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of the array of data into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays, one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, called a pivot, based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.

## Features

- Simple and efficient sorting algorithm.
- Recursive implementation.
- Handles arrays with duplicate values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HamzaMehboob/AlgoWiz.git
    cd AlgoWiz/Algorithms/Sorting/QuickSort_Python
    ```

2. Run the example script:
    ```sh
    python quicksort.py
    ```
