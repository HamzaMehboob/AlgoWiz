# ChaCha20 Encryption Algorithm

This project implements the ChaCha20 stream cipher in Python using the `pycryptodome` library. ChaCha20 is a fast and secure encryption algorithm designed to provide both confidentiality and integrity.

## Files
- **`chacha20.py`**: Contains the `ChaCha20Cipher` class, which provides methods for encryption and decryption.
- **`example.py`**: Demonstrates how to use the `ChaCha20Cipher` class.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.


## Usage
To use the ChaCha20 algorithm, you can run the example.py script: python example.py

This script will:

Encrypt a plaintext message using ChaCha20.
Decrypt the encrypted message to retrieve the original plaintext.
