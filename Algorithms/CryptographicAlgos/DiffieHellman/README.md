# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Example

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, split into a module (`diffie_hellman.py`) for the DiffieHellman class and an example script (`example.py`) to demonstrate its usage.

## Files

- `diffie_hellman.py`: Contains the DiffieHellman class with methods for key generation and shared key computation.
- `example.py`: Demonstrates how to use the DiffieHellman class.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
