# MD5 Hashing in Python

This project demonstrates how to use the MD5 hashing algorithm in Python to hash strings and file contents. MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) is widely used for creating a fixed-size hash value from variable-sized input data.

## Files

1. **`hash.py`** - A script to compute the MD5 hash of a given string and file.
2. **`example.py`** - A script to use hash.py for string and file conversion
3. **`exampleFile.txt`** - A sample text file used for hashing demonstration (created by running `create_example.py`).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required beyond the Python standard library.

## Usage
To use the md5 algorithm, you can run the example.py script: python example.py
