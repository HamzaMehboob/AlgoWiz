# Linear Regression

This project implements a simple linear regression model using Python. It demonstrates how to fit a model, make predictions, evaluate performance, and visualize results.

## Features

- Fit a linear regression model
- Make predictions with the trained model
- Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R^2 score
- Plot the regression line and data points

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run the code:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HamzaMehboob/AlgoWiz.git
    cd AlgoWiz/Algorithms/MachineLearning/LinearRegression
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the `example.py` script:

    ```bash
    python example.py
    ```

4. You will see the Mean Squared Error, R^2 Score, and a plot of the regression line with data points.
