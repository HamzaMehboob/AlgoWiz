# Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning

This repository contains an implementation of the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, used for decision-making in two-player games. The algorithm finds the optimal move for a player assuming the opponent plays optimally.

## Files

- `minimax_alpha_beta.py`: Contains the implementation of the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- `example.py`: Provides an example of how to use the `MinimaxAlphaBeta` class.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**: This implementation requires Python's standard library.

2. **Run Example Script**: Use the provided example script to see the algorithm in action.
    ```bash
    python example.py
    ```

3. **Customize**: Implement the `is_terminal`, `evaluate`, and `get_children` methods in `minimax_alpha_beta.py` to suit your specific problem. 

## Example

The `example.py` script demonstrates how to use the `MinimaxAlphaBeta` class. The example provided uses a simple numeric node value with children nodes generated by incrementing and decrementing the node value. You will need to replace these with actual implementations based on your specific problem.
